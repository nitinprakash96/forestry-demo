In vector calculus, **divergence** is a vector operator that operates on a vector field, producing a scalar field giving the quantity of the vector field's source at each point.

In physical terms, the divergence of a vector field is the extent to which the vector field flux behaves like a source at a given point. It is a local measure of its _outgoingness_ â€“ the extent to which there are more of the field vectors exiting an infinitesimal region of space than entering it. 

* A point at which the flux is outgoing has positive divergence and is often called a _source_ of the field. 
* A point at which the flux is directed inward has negative divergence and is often called a _sink_ of the field
