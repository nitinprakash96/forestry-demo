title: Divergence
description: "In vector calculus, **divergence** is a vector operator that operates
  on a vector field, producing a scalar field giving the quantity of the vector field's
  source at each point.\n\nIn physical terms, the divergence of a vector field is
  the extent to which the vector field flux behaves like a source at a given point.
  It is a local measure of its _outgoingness_ â€“ the extent to which there are more
  of the field vectors exiting an infinitesimal region of space than entering it.
  \n\n* A point at which the flux is outgoing has positive divergence and is often
  called a _source_ of the field. \n* A point at which the flux is directed inward
  has negative divergence and is often called a _sink_ of the field\n\nIn Cartesian
  coordinate system,\n\n![{\\\\displaystyle \\\\operatorname {div} \\\\mathbf {F}
